# Sardyne: Estimating genome quality using pseudogenes

This is part of the [Extremely Open Science Project](https://www.big-data-biology.org/extremely-open-science/), where we are developing a tool for genome evaluation in the open. See the [project notes](https://github.com/BigDataBiology/sardyne/blob/main/notes/stream-notes.md#2024-04-06) for more information.

## Getting started

1. Follow the instructions on `notes/startup.md` to get started.
2. Get the data (`data/` subdirectory) by running the `download-data.py` Jugfile (`jug execute download-data.py`).
3. Change into the `source/` directory and run the `simulate.py` Jugfile to run the main analysis (`jug execute run-sardyne.py`). This will take a while.
4. The other files in `source/` are exploring the results. This is a WIP.
