# Sardyne: Estimating genome quality using pseudogenes

This is part of the [Extremely Open Science Project](https://www.big-data-biology.org/extremely-open-science/), where we are developing a tool for genome evaluation in the open. See the [project notes](https://github.com/BigDataBiology/sardyne/blob/main/notes/stream-notes.md#2024-04-06) for more information.
